# Window Tiler App
A dynamic window tiling system built with React, inspired by modern OS window managers like Windows and macOS. This app lets users create draggable, colorful windows that snap to screen edges or nested grids with smooth animations and intuitive visual cues.

## Features
- Create multiple floating windows with random colors and random initial positions.
- Drag windows freely or snap them to screen edges: top, bottom, left, and right.
- Snap indicators show near edges when dragging close for easy snapping.
- Snapped windows resize to take 50% of the snapped axis.
- Nested snapping inside snapped windows allows flexible sub-grid layouts.
- Windows can be closed anytime; neighboring windows adjust to fill the space.
- Smooth snap animations with bounce effects.
- Sound feedback on snapping actions for better UX.

## Usage
- Click the + button at the bottom right to create new windows.
- Drag windows by their top bar to move them freely.
- Drag windows near screen edges or inside snapped windows to snap them.
- Click the ✕ button on any window to close it.
- Experience smooth animations and sound feedback during snap actions.

## Technologies Used: 
React, 
Framer Motion (for drag & animation), 
Tailwind CSS (for styling), 
Lucide-react (for icons)..
